# Phaser ECS Framework

## Overview
This project builds a flexible starting framework for 2D grid-based, turn-based web games using React, Phaser, and TypeScript. It is scaffolded from the [React Phaser TypeScript template](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-react-ts).

## Quickstart
`npm i` and `npm run dev`

## Key Features
- Square grid-based, tile-based, bounded map system
- Player character with WASD movement control
- Flexible entity-component system (ECS) for broad control of entity properties and interactions  
- React interface for creating and placing static (scenery) and mobile (NPC) entities
- Turn-based game loop integrating player and NPC movement
- Development-focused interface for rapid prototyping and testing

## Project Goals
1. Create a flexible foundation for 2D grid-based game development
2. Evaluate [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) as a tool for:
   - Rapid project setup and iteration
   - Supporting independent learning and skill development for junior/mid-level developers
   - Accelerating understanding of complex architectural patterns like ECS

## Development Philosophy
This project prioritizes:
- Quick and flexible development
- Extensible entity-component architecture
- Developer tooling and testing capabilities over polished game controls
- Creating a development framework and experiment editor rather than a final game

For detailed requirements and specifications as used in Cursor scaffolding, see [requirements.md](./requirements.md).
